Blocks 470 - 1214 = 534,000 UTRMP

These were premined by the owners of [ypool.ga](http://ypool.ga) before release (not on their public pool, but behind closed doors). In fact they found another two and stole the ideas.

The repos were in a most innocuous sounding names. which leads me to suspect they have a "github bot".

[ypool.ga's](http://ypool.ga) url is not resolving, I assume they are using one of their other pools, or have set yet another one up. They usually have an IP beginning with 91 or 94 (even 95). They are not hard to find.

**If they return them via a giveaway to others or something, I would consider that very big of them.**
